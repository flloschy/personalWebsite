So as you have probably already seen in the footer... or rather the whole page, I only link to Github and Discord. But why?

Its quite simple actually, im not a fan at all of things like Instagram, Snapchat, TikTok, Twitter, Reddit or what not.
I don't see the reason of them. In my eyes these are just sites for people to make them selfs look good without much value
to the content you can find there. The algorithmically suggested content is also nothing i like, but sadly thats hard to avoid.
The only platforms Im utilizing for content consumption are youtube and twitch, youtube is mostly suggesting me educational
videos and twitch is just background noise.

And thus Im only linking Github and Discord. I hope you understand, if not, i don't really care anyway :p
